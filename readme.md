Linear Regression Project

Overview

This project uses linear regression to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and age of the house. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a sample dataset containing information on 10 houses, including their square footage, number of bedrooms, age, and price.

Features

Square_Feet: The square footage of the house
Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house
Age: The age of the house
Price: The price of the house
Model

The model used in this project is a linear regression model, which is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data.

Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE) metric, which measures the average difference between the predicted and actual prices.

Results

The model achieves a mean absolute error of [insert MAE value] on the testing data.
